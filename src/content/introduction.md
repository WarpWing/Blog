# Hello World!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ty "WarpWing" Chermsirivatana. A little bit about me, I am a 19-year-old male, based in New York, presently pursuing a major in Law and Policy with a minor in Computer Science as a Freshman at Dickinson College. 
As you can tell, I'm starting a blog! I'm mostly going to talk about my adventures in DevOps, Server Infrastructure, Artifical Intelligence, Cybersecurity and pretty much anything else I find interesting!
In my current capacity, I serve as the DevSecOps Consultant for [SkyCrypt](https://github.com/SkyCryptWebsite/SkyCrypt) and contribute as a DevOps Engineer and FOSS Developer for the [SkyStats](https://github.com/skystatsdev) project and Dickinson College's [FarmData2](https://github.com/FarmData2/FarmData2) Project, respectively.

I'm not sure what my first topic is going to be about. It's likely going to be about my time at SkyCrypt and the challenges that come with developing and scaling an application that's recieved 300k+ total users, billions of requests and over 450TB (factoring in site + API traffic) of outbound data. 
Full transparency, I will say that those numbers may be inaccurate because Cloudflare has a 30 day retention period and SkyCrypt's log retention with Grafana is only about 90 days. Regardless, if you find my blogs interesting or the topics excited, feel free to stick around! 

I also want to give a quick shoutout to [saicaca](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) who I don't know personally but has this kickass blog template that was easy to setup!

In addition, if you have something you want to talk about or just say hi, you can contact me on Discord (You can check the left hand profile for that!).
